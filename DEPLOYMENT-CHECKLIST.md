# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Code Quality
- [x] Build passes without errors (`npm run build`)
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] No console errors in development
- [x] Hydration issues resolved
- [x] Category click functionality removed
- [x] Dummy data script updated with 50 realistic voters

### 2. Environment Setup
- [ ] Create `.env.local` with production Supabase credentials
- [ ] Verify Supabase project is active
- [ ] Test database connection
- [ ] Ensure Supabase RLS policies are configured

### 3. Database Preparation
- [ ] Run `./seed-database.sh` to populate production database
- [ ] Verify 50 voter records are created
- [ ] Test category calculations work correctly
- [ ] Confirm search functionality works

### 4. GitHub Repository
- [ ] Run `./setup-github.sh`
- [ ] Create new repository on GitHub
- [ ] Push code to GitHub
- [ ] Verify repository is public/private as intended

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: GitHub Setup
```bash
./setup-github.sh
```

**Manual Steps:**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `solyn-voter-database`
3. Make public or private
4. Don't initialize with README
5. Create repository
6. Follow the script instructions to connect local repo

### Step 2: Vercel Deployment
```bash
./deploy-production.sh
```

**What the script does:**
- Updates seeding script with production credentials
- Seeds production database with 50 voters
- Builds production application
- Deploys to Vercel
- Opens Vercel dashboard for configuration

### Step 3: Vercel Configuration
1. **Link GitHub Repository**: Connect your GitHub repo
2. **Environment Variables**: Add production Supabase credentials
3. **Build Settings**: Verify Next.js settings
4. **Domain Configuration**: Add your custom domain

### Step 4: Custom Domain Setup
1. **Add Domain in Vercel**: 
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
   - Add your custom domain

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Add CNAME record pointing to your Vercel deployment
   - Example: `www.yourdomain.com` â†’ `your-project.vercel.app`

3. **SSL Certificate**:
   - Vercel automatically provides SSL
   - Verify HTTPS is working

## ðŸ”§ Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Application Functionality
- [ ] Main page loads without errors
- [ ] Voter database tab displays data
- [ ] Categories tab shows calculated categories
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Navigation between tabs works
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

### 2. Database Verification
- [ ] 50 voter records are visible
- [ ] Categories are calculated correctly
- [ ] Search filters work properly
- [ ] Data updates in real-time

### 3. Performance Check
- [ ] Page load times are acceptable
- [ ] No console errors in production
- [ ] Images and assets load correctly
- [ ] Mobile performance is good

### 4. Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Environment variables are not exposed
- [ ] Supabase connection is secure
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Setup

### 1. Vercel Analytics
- [ ] Enable Vercel Analytics
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure error tracking

### 2. Supabase Monitoring
- [ ] Enable database monitoring
- [ ] Set up query performance alerts
- [ ] Monitor API usage

### 3. Domain Health
- [ ] Set up domain monitoring
- [ ] Configure uptime alerts
- [ ] SSL certificate monitoring

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Check for dependency updates
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Backup database regularly
- [ ] Update documentation

### Updates
- [ ] Pull latest changes from GitHub
- [ ] Test locally before deploying
- [ ] Update dependencies safely
- [ ] Deploy with `./deploy-production.sh`

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Check TypeScript errors and dependencies
2. **Database Connection**: Verify Supabase credentials and network
3. **Hydration Errors**: Ensure ClientOnly components are used
4. **Domain Issues**: Check DNS configuration and SSL certificates
